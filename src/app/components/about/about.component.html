          I’ve had an amazing career doing design work for over 10 years on a variety of projects and clients from all over the world, ranging from start-ups and small businesses to large scale companies like Google, Viacom and many more.

        I specialize in Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as Cinema 4D, but I also do print, web, UI, audio and video work.

        I get excited about making awesome work. If you have a project in mind that you think I’d be a good fit for, shoot me a message! Cheers.
